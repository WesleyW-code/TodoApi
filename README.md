# TodoApi
 I worked through a Microsoft tutorial to build this API using C# and .Net
 
 I completed the tutorial at [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code).
 
 The purpose of this was to broaden my C# knowledge, as well as to introduce myself to .NET APIs.
 
 WeatherForcast: Randomly predicts the weather over the next 5 days.
 - It has only one method at /GetWeatherForecast that performs this function.
 
 Todoitems: Allows one to manage their to do items, where a to do item includes an ID, the task and whether it has been completed or not.
 - It has full CRUD functionality, to add, update, delete and view the to do items.
